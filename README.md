Project elaborating on tests in the context of Aras Innovator

## Aras General XUnit Tests

### Arrange Wrapper

Failed tests due to errors in the arrange phase is in my experience the most common case for a failing test. By wrapping the arrange phase within an ArrangeWrapper it will provide information about the failed test, that it is an arrange error. I.e. it is not necessary a "failed test".
